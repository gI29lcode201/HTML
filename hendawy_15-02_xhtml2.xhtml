        <h1><strong>Joan Didion</strong></h1>
        <section>
            <p>Joan Didion (/ˈdɪdiən/; December 5, 1934 – December 23, 2021) was an American writer
                and journalist. She is considered one of the pioneers of <q>New Journalism</q> along
                with <em>Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, and Tom Wolfe.[2][3][4]</em></p>
            <h2><strong>New Journalism and Influence</strong></h2>

            <p>Over the course of her career, Didion wrote essays for many magazines, including<em>
                    The Saturday Evening Post</em>, <em>Life</em>, <em>Esquire</em>, <em>The New
                    York Review of Books and The New Yorker</em>. Her writing during the 1960s
                through the late 1970s engaged audiences in the realities of the counterculture of
                the 1960s, the Hollywood lifestyle, and the history and culture of California.
                Didion's political writing in the 1980s and 1990s often concentrated on the subtext
                of political rhetoric and the United States's foreign policy in Latin America.[6][7]
                In 1991, she wrote the earliest mainstream media article to suggest the Central Park
                Five had been wrongfully convicted.</p>

            <p>Didion won the National Book Award for Nonfiction and was a finalist for both the
                National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize for The Year of Magical
                Thinking, a memoir of the year following the death of her husband, writer John
                Gregory Dunne. She later adapted the book into a play that premiered on Broadway in
                2007. In 2013, she was awarded the National Humanities Medal by president Barack
                Obama.</p>
